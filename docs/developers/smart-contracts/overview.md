# QUBIC Smart Contract

QUBIC smart contracts are decentralized `C++` programs that execute directly on baremetal hardware, eliminating the need for traditional operating systems or virtual machines. This low-level execution model provides high performance, low latency, and fine-grained control over computation. Unlike conventional blockchain platforms, QUBIC offers a unique architecture where contracts run closer to the hardware, ensuring deterministic and efficient execution across the network.

Each smart contract can be launched through an IPO (Initial Public Offering), a mechanism that gathers community support and allocates computing resources to the contract. This system ensures that only valuable and trusted computations receive execution time, making QUBIC smart contracts efficient, scalable, and suitable for advanced decentralized applications.

# Key Features

**1. Baremetal Execution**

Smart contracts run directly on the hardware—without an OS, VM, or container layer—allowing extremely low-level control, high-speed execution, and minimal overhead.

**2. IPO-Based Deployment (Initial Public Offering)**

Each contract must be proposed through an IPO process where the community allocates compute resources (votes) for execution. This crowdsourced validation ensures only useful or trusted logic consumes network power.

**3. No Virtual Machine, No Gas Model**

There is no EVM-like gas mechanism. Instead, compute resources are provisioned via IPO and scheduled execution, avoiding the need for micro-fees or instruction-based billing.
