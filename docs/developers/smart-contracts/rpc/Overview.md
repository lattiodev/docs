# Overview

In the previous section, we learned how to interact with your contract using `qubic-cli` by communicating directly with your node. However, in a real production environment, it is unlikely that you'll interact with the node directly. Instead, you'll typically work with the [RPC server](https://docs.qubic.org/api/rpc/).

This chapter will guide you through setting up your own testnet RPC server and show you how to interact with it using the [ts-library](https://github.com/qubic/ts-library).
