# Overview

In Qubic, smart contracts are implemented in a restricted variant of **C++** and compiled into the Qubic Core executable.

To isolate contracts, access to other contracts and Core internals is only allowed via the `QPI` (Qubic Programming Interface), the sole external dependency permitted. Using libraries is forbidden. Contracts also cannot use insecure **C++** features like pointers, low-level arrays (no bounds checking), or preprocessor directives. All memory is zero-initialized, so contracts never access uninitialized memory.

A contract has a state struct, containing all its data as member variables. The memory available to the contract is allocated statically, but extending the state will be possible between epochs through special `EXPAND` events.

**Contract developers should note that some parts of the Qubic protocol are not yet implemented.**

- Contract execution will eventually incur fees, paid from a fee reserve funded by QUs burned during the IPO and through ongoing burns. A contract must continue burning QUs to stay activeâ€”once the reserve is empty, it stops executing.

- In the future, managing contracts will also need to pay for ledger entries, so collecting fees during asset issuance is recommended.
