# Become a Developer

Welcome to Qubic development! This guide will help you navigate the available resources and direct you to the tools you need for your specific use case.

## Choose Your Path

### 1. Building Smart Contracts

If you want to create and deploy smart contracts on Qubic:

1. **Start with the Overview**
   - Read our comprehensive [Smart Contracts Overview](smart-contracts/overview.md) to understand Qubic's unique baremetal execution model
   - Learn about IPO-based deployment and the advantages of running contracts without VMs or gas fees

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Follow our [Development Environment Setup](dev-kit.md) guide for Visual Studio and Qubic Core
   - Complete the [Getting Started Tutorial](smart-contracts/getting-started/setup-enviroment.md) for hands-on experience

3. **Learn Contract Development**
   - Master the [Qubic Programming Interface (QPI)](qpi.md) - your complete guide to contract APIs
   - Understand [Contract Structure](smart-contracts/smart-contract/contract-structure.md) and [Data Types](smart-contracts/smart-contract/data-types.md)
   - Explore [Procedures and Functions](smart-contracts/smart-contract/procedures-and-functions.md)

4. **Practice with Examples**
   - Study [Assets and Shares Examples](smart-contracts/sc-by-examples/assets-and-shares.md)
   - Try the [QNS (Qubic Name Service) Example](smart-contracts/sc-by-examples/qns.md)

5. **Test and Deploy**
   - Use our [CLI Tools](smart-contracts/cli/Overview.md) for contract interaction
   - Follow [Testing Guidelines](smart-contracts/testing/overview.md) and access [Testnet Resources](testnet-resources.md)

### 2. Building Frontend Applications

If you want to build applications that interact with the Qubic network:

1. **Connect to Qubic Nodes**
   - Use our [RPC endpoints](../api/rpc.md) to connect to public nodes or set up your own
   - Follow the [RPC Setup Guide](smart-contracts/rpc/setup-rpc.md) for detailed configuration
   - The main testnet endpoint is available at `https://testnet-rpc.qubic.org`

2. **Integrate Wallet Solutions**
   - For complete wallet integration examples (MetaMask Snap, WalletConnect, Seed phrases, Vault files), check out the [HM25 Frontend Example](https://github.com/icyblob/hm25-frontend)
   - This repository demonstrates all key wallet connection methods

3. **Use the TypeScript Library**
   - The [Qubic TypeScript Library](https://github.com/qubic/ts-library) provides tools for creating transactions and interacting with the network
   - See our [TypeScript Library docs](library-typescript.md) for installation instructions

### 3. Smart Contract Interaction

To interact with existing smart contracts:

1. **Learn Contract Interaction Basics**
   - Check our [Frontend Integration](frontend-integration.md) guide for an overview
   - The [HM25 Frontend Example](https://github.com/icyblob/hm25-frontend) contains complete implementation examples

2. **Understand Data Structures**
   - Smart contracts use specific input/output structures defined in their code
   - Find example code in the [HM25 Template](https://github.com/qubic/core/blob/madrid-2025/src/contracts/HM25.h)
