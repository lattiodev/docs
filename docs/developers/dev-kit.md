# Qubic Dev Kit

The [Qubic Dev Kit](https://github.com/qubic/qubic-dev-kit) is your go-to tool for setting up a Qubic testnet node and running the HM25 Smart Contract demo for Hackathon Madrid 2025. It streamlines the process for developers looking to create and test their own smart contracts.

## Important Notes

- **Dev Kit Requirements**: Essential for developing and testing smart contracts, simulating the entire Qubic blockchain in a single environment. If you only need to interact with existing contracts, consider using the RPC API and wallet solutions instead.

- **Support and Resources**: For any questions or if you need a server setup, please reach out in the #dev channel on our Discord. We may be able to provide server resources and assistance.

## Overview

The Dev Kit manages:
- Complete Qubic development environment setup
- EFI file building
- Testnet node deployment with your smart contract
- RPC access for testing

## Getting Started

For complete documentation, check out the Dev Kit on GitHub: [Qubic Dev Kit](https://github.com/qubic/qubic-dev-kit)

## Key Features

- **Optimized for Demo Branch**: The Dev Kit works with the `madrid-2025` branch of the Qubic core repository
- **Built-in Smart Contract Template**: Includes the HM25 template smart contract with Echo and Burn functions
- **One-Command Deployment**: Deploy a complete node with your smart contract using a single command
