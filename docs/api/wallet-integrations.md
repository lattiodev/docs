# Wallet Integrations

## Official WalletConnect Integration

For detailed information on integrating the Qubic Wallet with your dApp, refer to the [official WalletConnect documentation](https://github.com/qubic/wallet-app/blob/main/walletconnect.md).

## MetaMask Snap Integration

For integrating with MetaMask, check out the [Qubic MetaMask Snap](https://github.com/qubic/qubic-mm-snap) developed by Monoape. You can also find the snap [here](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/qubic-lib/qubic-mm-snap/).

## Example Implementations

You can find example implementations for WalletConnect, MetaMask Snap, Vault, and Seed integrations on the [HM25 frontend](https://github.com/qubic/hm25-frontend). These examples demonstrate how each wallet type can connect and interact with Qubic smart contracts.

## Other Integrations

While there are other integrations available, such as Vault and Seed, we do not recommend using them for production applications.
